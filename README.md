# CI/CD With cloudbuild 

In this example show and explains how to create a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline on Google Cloud using only hosted products and the popular GitOps methodology.

At the end you create a CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds a container image from committed code, stores the image in Container Registry, updates a Kubernetes manifest in a Git repository, and deploys the application to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) using that manifest.

If the ```gcloud config get-value project``` command does not return the ID of the project you selected, configure Cloud Shell to use your project.
gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]

## Enable the required APIs.
```shell
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com \
    cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
    sourcerepo.googleapis.com \
    containeranalysis.googleapis.com
```

## Create a GKE cluster that you will use to deploy the sample application.


```shell
gcloud container clusters create hello-cloudbuild \
    --num-nodes 1 --zone us-central1-b
```

## Use Git, configure it with your name and email address. Git will use those to identify you as the author of the commits

```shell
git config --global user.email "[YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS]"
git config --global user.name "[YOUR_NAME]"
```

## Run the gcloud credential helper. This will connect your Google Cloud user account to Cloud Source Repositories.

```shell
git config --global credential.helper gcloud.sh
```

## Creating the Git repositories in Cloud Source Repositories

Create the two Git repositories (app and env), and initialize the app one with some sample code.
Create the two Git repositories.

```shell
gcloud source repos create hello-cloudbuild-app
gcloud source repos create hello-cloudbuild-env
```

## Clone the sample code from GitHub.

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/alioualarbi/cicd-with-cloudbuild \
    hello-cloudbuild-app
```

## Configure Cloud Source Repositories as a remote.

```
cd ~/hello-cloudbuild-app
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
git remote add google \
    "https://source.developers.google.com/p/${PROJECT_ID}/r/hello-cloudbuild-app"
```
*app.py* file
```
from flask import Flask
app = Flask('hello-cloudbuild')

@app.route('/')
def hello():
  return "Hello World!\n"

if __name__ == '__main__':
  app.run(host = '0.0.0.0', port = 8080)
  ```
*Dockerfile*
```
FROM python:3.7-slim
RUN pip install flask
WORKDIR /app
COPY app.py /app/app.py
ENTRYPOINT ["python"]
CMD ["/app/app.py"]
 ``` 
With this Dockerfile, you can create a container image with Cloud Build and store it in Container Registry.

## Create a Cloud Build build based on the latest commit with the following command.

```
cd ~/hello-cloudbuild-app
COMMIT_ID="$(git rev-parse --short=7 HEAD)"
gcloud builds submit --tag="gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/hello-cloudbuild:${COMMIT_ID}" .
Cloud Build streams the logs generated by the creation of the container image to your terminal when you execute this command.
```
Verify that your new container image is available in Container Registry.
  
## Creating the continuous integration pipeline
You configure Cloud Build to automatically run a small unit test, build the container image, and then push it to Container Registry. Pushing a new commit to Cloud Source Repositories automatically triggers this pipeline. The `*cloudbuild.yaml*` file included in the code is the pipeline's configuration.

*cloudbuild.yaml*

```
steps:
# This step runs the unit tests on the app
- name: 'python:3.7-slim'
  id: Test
  entrypoint: /bin/sh
  args:
  - -c
  - 'pip install flask && python test_app.py -v'

# This step builds the container image.
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  id: Build
  args:
  - 'build'
  - '-t'
  - 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/hello-cloudbuild:$SHORT_SHA'
  - '.'

# This step pushes the image to Container Registry
# The PROJECT_ID and SHORT_SHA variables are automatically
# replaced by Cloud Build.
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  id: Push
  args:
  - 'push'
  - 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/hello-cloudbuild:$SHORT_SHA'
```
## Create Cloud Build Triggers

Open the Cloud Build Triggers page > Triggers > Create trigger.
Fill out the following options as below:

- **Name** field, type hello-cloudbuild.
- **Event**, select Push to a branch.
- **Source**, select hello-cloudbuild-app as your Repository and ^master$ as your Branch.
- **Build configuration**, select Cloud Build configuration file.
- **Cloud Build configuration file location** field, type cloudbuild.yaml after the /.

Click **Create** to save your build trigger.

Push the application code to *Cloud Source Repositories* to trigger the CI pipeline in Cloud Build.

```
cd ~/hello-cloudbuild-app
git push google master
```

Go to Cloud Build console > Cloud Build > Click the build to follow its execution and examine its logs.

## Creating the continuous delivery pipeline
### Granting Cloud Build access to GKE

Set the Project number environement and grant *container.develope* role to the Cloud build service account.
```
PROJECT_NUMBER="$(gcloud projects describe ${PROJECT_ID} --format='get(projectNumber)')"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_NUMBER} \
    --member=serviceAccount:${PROJECT_NUMBER}@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com \
    --role=roles/container.developer

```

### Initializing the hello-cloudbuild-env repository
You need to initialize the hello-cloudbuild-env repository with two branches (production and candidate) and a Cloud Build configuration file describing the deployment process.
Clone the *hello-cloudbuild-env* repository and create the production branch.

```
cd ~
gcloud source repos clone hello-cloudbuild-env
cd ~/hello-cloudbuild-env
git checkout -b production
```

Copy the *cloudbuild-delivery.yaml* file available in the hello-cloudbuild-app repository and commit the change.

```
cd ~/hello-cloudbuild-env
cp ~/hello-cloudbuild-app/cloudbuild-delivery.yaml ~/hello-cloudbuild-env/cloudbuild.yaml
git add .
git commit -m "Create cloudbuild.yaml for deployment"
```

The *cloudbuild-delivery.yaml* file describes the deployment process to be run in Cloud Build. It has two steps:
Cloud Build applies the manifest on the GKE cluster.
If successful, Cloud Build copies the manifest on the production branch.

```
steps:
# This step deploys the new version of our container image
# in the hello-cloudbuild Kubernetes Engine cluster.
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/kubectl'
  id: Deploy
  args:
  - 'apply'
  - '-f'
  - 'kubernetes.yaml'
  env:
  - 'CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE=us-central1-b'
  - 'CLOUDSDK_CONTAINER_CLUSTER=hello-cloudbuild'

# This step copies the applied manifest to the production branch
# The COMMIT_SHA variable is automatically
# replaced by Cloud Build.
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/git'
  id: Copy to production branch
  entrypoint: /bin/sh
  args:
  - '-c'
  - |
    set -x && \
    # Configure Git to create commits with Cloud Build's service account
    git config user.email $(gcloud auth list --filter=status:ACTIVE --format='value(account)') && \
    # Switch to the production branch and copy the kubernetes.yaml file from the candidate branch
    git fetch origin production && git checkout production && \
    git checkout $COMMIT_SHA kubernetes.yaml && \
    # Commit the kubernetes.yaml file with a descriptive commit message
    git commit -m "Manifest from commit $COMMIT_SHA
    $(git log --format=%B -n 1 $COMMIT_SHA)" && \
    # Push the changes back to Cloud Source Repository
    git push origin production
 
 ```
### Create a candidate branch and push both branches for them to be available in Cloud Source Repositories.

```
git checkout -b candidate
git push origin production
git push origin candidate
```

Grant the Source Repository Writer IAM role to the Cloud Build service account for the hello-cloudbuild-env repository.

```
PROJECT_NUMBER="$(gcloud projects describe ${PROJECT_ID} \
    --format='get(projectNumber)')"
```
```
cat >/tmp/hello-cloudbuild-env-policy.yaml <<EOF
bindings:
- members:
  - serviceAccount:${PROJECT_NUMBER}@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/source.writer
EOF
```
```
gcloud source repos set-iam-policy \
    hello-cloudbuild-env /tmp/hello-cloudbuild-env-policy.yaml
```

## Creating the trigger for the continuous delivery pipeline

Configure the Cloud Build to be triggered by a push to the candidate branch of the hello-cloudbuild-env repository.
Open the Triggers page of Cloud Build > Triggers > Create trigger.

Fill out the following options:

- **Name** field, type hello-cloudbuild-deploy.
- **Event**, select Push to a branch.
- **Source**, select hello-cloudbuild-env as your Repository and ^candidate$ as your Branch.
- **Build configuration**, select Cloud Build configuration file (yaml or json).
- **Cloud Build configuration file location** location field, type cloudbuild.yaml after the /.

Click **Create**.

### Modifying the continuous integration pipeline to trigger the continuous delivery pipeline

Add some steps to the continuous integration pipeline that generates a new version of the Kubernetes manifest and push it to the hello-cloudbuild-env repository to trigger the continuous delivery pipeline.

Replace the *cloudbuild.yaml* file with the extended example in the *cloudbuild-trigger-cd.yaml* file.

```
cd ~/hello-cloudbuild-app
cp cloudbuild-trigger-cd.yaml cloudbuild.yaml
```

The *cloudbuild-trigger-cd.yaml* is an extended version of the *cloudbuild.yaml file*. It adds steps to generate the new Kubernetes manifest and trigger the continuous delivery pipeline.

```
# This step clones the hello-cloudbuild-env repository
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud'
  id: Clone env repository
  entrypoint: /bin/sh
  args:
  - '-c'
  - |
    gcloud source repos clone hello-cloudbuild-env && \
    cd hello-cloudbuild-env && \
    git checkout candidate && \
    git config user.email $(gcloud auth list --filter=status:ACTIVE --format='value(account)')

# This step generates the new manifest
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud'
  id: Generate manifest
  entrypoint: /bin/sh
  args:
  - '-c'
  - |
     sed "s/GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT/${PROJECT_ID}/g" kubernetes.yaml.tpl | \
     sed "s/COMMIT_SHA/${SHORT_SHA}/g" > hello-cloudbuild-env/kubernetes.yaml

# This step pushes the manifest back to hello-cloudbuild-env
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud'
  id: Push manifest
  entrypoint: /bin/sh
  args:
  - '-c'
  - |
    set -x && \
    cd hello-cloudbuild-env && \
    git add kubernetes.yaml && \
    git commit -m "Deploying image gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/hello-cloudbuild:${SHORT_SHA}
    Built from commit ${COMMIT_SHA} of repository hello-cloudbuild-app
    Author: $(git log --format='%an <%ae>' -n 1 HEAD)" && \
    git push origin candidate
```

Commit the modifications and push them to Cloud Source Repositories.

```
cd ~/hello-cloudbuild-app
git add cloudbuild.yaml
git commit -m "Trigger CD pipeline"
git push google master
```

This triggers the continuous integration pipeline in Cloud Build.

**Examine the continuous integration build.**

Go to Cloud Build, your recently run and finished builds for the *hello-cloudbuild-app* repository appear. You can click on a build to follow its execution and examine its logs. The last step of this pipeline pushes the new manifest to the hello-cloudbuild-env repository, which triggers the continuous delivery pipeline.

**Examine the continuous delivery build.**

Go to Cloud Build,your recently run and finished builds for the hello-cloudbuild-env repository appear. You can click on a build to follow its execution and examine its logs.

## Testing the complete pipeline

The complete CI/CD pipeline is now configured. You test it from end to end.
Go to the GKE Services page > Go to Google Kubernetes Engine Services
The list contains a single service called hello-cloudbuild created by the recently completed continuous delivery build.

Click on the endpoint for the hello-cloudbuild service. "Hello World!" appears. If there is no endpoint, or if you see a load balancer error, you might have to wait a few minutes for the load balancer to be completely initialized. 

Replace "Hello World" by "Hello Cloud Build", both in the application and in the unit test.

```
cd ~/hello-cloudbuild-app
sed -i 's/Hello World/Hello Cloud Build/g' app.py
sed -i 's/Hello World/Hello Cloud Build/g' test_app.py
```

Commit and push the change to Cloud Source Repositories.

```
git add app.py test_app.py
git commit -m "Hello Cloud Build"
git push google master
```

This triggers the full CI/CD pipeline.
After a few minutes, reload the application in your browser. "Hello Cloud Build!" appears.
